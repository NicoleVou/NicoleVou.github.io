### Past week
This past week I got started on Project 3 and finished the algo homework. I'm glad to have a partner this time, unlike last time. We have made some really good progress so far and it feels good to almost be done. I think I overworked myself this week in fitness and socially. My hip flexor has been in alot of pain and I stayed up way too late several nights hanging out with friends which really messed up my sleep schedule and put me behind on a bunch of work.

In class we discussed alot about memory managament: allocating memory, heap vs. stack, and deallocating memory. An object's lifetime can transcend its scope if it is stored in the heap, meaning other places of code can use the obejct. This project deals with making an allocator that gives the caller a chunk of memory for a requested number of object Ts.

### Whatâ€™s in my way###
I start my part-time internship at Under Armour tomorrow. I am super excited but a little bit scared of 15-20 hours of extra time being taken out of my week.

### What will I do next week###
Next week we will be finishing up our OOP project. I do not think it will take too much longer. So far this seems like the easier of the projects and I am not too worried about it. I am extremely excited to be back at Under Armour. I very much enjoy the app I work on, the work I do on the app, the people, and the workplace. Plus, free lunch on Fridays! Whoo!

### Tip-of-the-week###
Take preventitve measures on keeping yourself healthy. Mid to end of a semester is always a bad time to get sick and makes your life so much harder. I felt a cold coming on this week (gotten from my roommate) and I immediately upped my intake of vitamin C, took a bunch of pre-cold medicine, and cough medicine. I beat it before it got to me and I know my life is so much easier because of it.
