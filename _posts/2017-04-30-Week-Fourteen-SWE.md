### Experience in this class 
This past week Downing wrapped up the class with more common patterns. We re-implemented our factory method from last week with an abstract game class. Downing introduced the notion of a "visitor" pattern, something I've never heard of before. Basically, an object passes itself (as a visitor) to another class or method to have a function done on it. On Friday we started the student projects presentations, which will continue on through the end of classes.

### Past week  
This past week I had a presentation in my Computer Graphics class over our final project. The project isn't due until the last day of classes, and it was strange presenting on an unfiinished project. Other than that, this was a pretty standard week, with homework in various classes, and work at Under Armour.

And I FINALLY recieved the team I will be working on this summer at Facebook. I was skeptical of the team at first, "Facebook Ads Monitoring", but with the description my manager sent me, it seems like it will be an interesting challenge: "This team is responsible for processing all of Facebook’s ads revenue and we heavily use concepts from distributed systems, concurrent programming and data structures; coding is mostly in C++ 11/14". Pretty excited to continue in C++, which I have been using all year thanks to Downing's OOP and (not Downing's) Computer Graphics. 

### What’s in my way
DCCCD's inability to answer an email or phone call is driving me nuts right now. I'm trying to enroll in government classes during their maymester but their system is blocking me for false reasons.

### What will I do next week
This week will be action-packed, and by "action" I mean studying and homework. I've got two tests on the last two days of classes, and my final project for Computer Graphics due Friday.

My 21st birthday is also on Thursday but I'll be postponing that til the weekend :).

### Pick-of-the-week
For anyone in iOS mobile development, here's a nifty article on nil vs. NULL that my co-worker sent me:
