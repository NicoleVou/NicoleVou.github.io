### Past week
This past week was alot of preparing for the OOP exam, and then taking it. It was difficult but not impossible. It took me a long time to understand the last question and by the time I finally underatood what I needed to do I only had 2 minutes left to finish the exam. I didn't have time to rewrite my code, so I am hoping for a decent amount of partial credit. The test consisted of 6 coding questions and incorporated much of the concepts we convered in class. 
This past week in class we continued discussing iterators, the various types, and the various usages. We've been making classes for different types of iterators and containers that implement the various iterators. 
Also these past two weekends were pretty hectic. The last weekend I went to ACL all 3 days and this one I went to the Texas/OU game in Dallas. I am excited to have no big plans this week or next weekend. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way###
I finally have a free week. Next week I start interning at Under Armour though, which will make getting all my school work done that much harder. 

### What will I do next week###
Next week I look forward to being done with all my midterms. I am going to start working on the next project. I am not making the same mistake as last time and have already found a partner.

### Tip-of-the-week###
Paying attention and taking notes in class seemed to be the most beneficial way to study for the test. Looking through my own notes from the class helped alot more than reading the notes he posted, but they were also a good supplement. So pay attention in class!
