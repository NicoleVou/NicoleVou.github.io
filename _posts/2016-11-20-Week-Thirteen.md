### Past week
This past week was pretty busy. I had my Business Law and Ethics test on Tuesday, and had to catch up on about 10 chapters of reading before then. I felt the test went well and am looking forawrd to getting my grades back, especially since I did well on the recent "pop" quiz in that class. Tuesday and Wednesday I got pretty sick but also had much of the final OOP project left to do. The OOP project took longer than I had hoped and being sick made it much harder to complete.

This week we continued to really delve into the ways C++ handles object oriented programming, with the relationship between a parent and child classes. We discussed the different ways a parent's method is (or isn't) called on the child class. On Friday Downing talked alot about abstract methods: the motivation for using them and their consequences. He also breifly mentioned an inline method, which puts a method's code directly into where it is to be called, instead of actually calling the method. This can more efficient with respect to time, but make for a larger object file.

### Whatâ€™s in my way###
The biggest thing in my way is the ultimate gainz goblin known as Thanksgiving (yikes!). 

### What will I do next week###
Next week is a way lighter week since it is Thanksgiving break! I'm not going home since it is unreasonable to fly all the way back to North Carolina for 4 days, so I will be hanging out around Texas. I have to do algo homework and practical lienar algebra homework, as well as complete a couple of tickets pretty quickly before the next update release on MapMyFitness. Over Thanksgiving break I hope to get started on a simple app for my friends who own a tumbling and cheer business in North Austin: that just allows users to look at the gym's schedule and any news the gym has.
