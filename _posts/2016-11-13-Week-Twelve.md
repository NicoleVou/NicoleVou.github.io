### Past week
This past week was an easier week for me, and I used it as both a mental and physcial recovery week. All of my second round midterms were the week before and the OOP project isn't due until next week. I got some good grades back on those tests which I am pretty happy about. I had hurt my leg and back doing gymnastics last Sunday so I was unable to work out much this week which really affected my mood and productivity. I also had a phone interview with Facebook, so hopefully I will hear good news back from them.

In class we went over the next (and last :o) OOP project, Life. This project really seems to reflect some of the stuff we are learning with C++ and will really force us to program with an object oriented mindset. We've really started discussing how inheritance works in C++, like the way different methods/functions are called in parent and child classes.

### Whatâ€™s in my way###
Next week I have alot of stuff todo yet again, with a test on Tuesday, the algo homework due Wednesday, the OOP project due Thursday, and I start physical therapy for my hip flexor.

### What will I do next week###
Next week I will be getting back to working out (thank God), and I am going to try to workout more in the mornings rather than late at night. Monday I will be reading for my LEB exam, and then the rest of the week will be divied up working on OOP and algo. And as always I will be working as well.


### Pick-of-the-week###
Since I work on iOS apps, I have started reading the [Swift Developer Blog](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/) to keep updated with the new features apple offers for swift and objective c.
