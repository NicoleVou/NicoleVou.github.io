### Past week
This past Monday was my favorite holiday, Halloween! But there was also an algo test, and an OOP project due. Surprisingly I felt pretty good about the algo exam and am curious to see my score. Unfortunately my partner and I had to turn in our project late even though we had finished hours earlier. We made a silly mistake and looked for a nonexistent bug for 6 hours due to comparing our output to someone else's wrong output. 

In class this past week we continued to compare the stack vs. the heap, and the 6 different types of variables: local, static local, global, static global, class (instance), and class static. We compared them by answering these 5 questions for each: How many are there? Where are they allocated? When are they initialized? What is their lifetime? What is their scope? 


### Whatâ€™s in my way###
This week not much is in my way. I just have the usual homework in practical linear algebra and work at Under Armour.

### What will I do next week###
I finally have a lighter week next week. I will be doing some interview prep and applying to more summer internships. I have a couple cover letter to write for various companies. I have a lot of working out and tumbling to do.

### Tip-of-the-week###
Double check that your tests and testing output are correct before assuming it is your code that is wrong. While that is rarely the case, it happened to my partner and I this week which cost us 6 hours and 20 points.
