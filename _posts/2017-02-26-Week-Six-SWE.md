title: Week Six SWE
---

### Experience in this class 
This week in class we focused on iterators and generators. Downing gave us a lot of time to build different types of iterators and generators with our peers in class, which enhanced our uunderstanding and familiarity with them. We implemeneted these both as functions and classes. The key points to take away from this week were: iterators are exhaustible and generators are lazy.

### Past week
This past week was mostly spent on finishing up the Computer Graphics project that was due last Sunday. None of the class had finished so the teacher had given us a "post-mortem" period where we could turn-in for partial credit (bless her). It was a relief to finally squash the last bug on Thursday and be able to start worrying about the next project. I started to study for the SWE test a little bit, as well as the usual tasks of doing homework for computer networks and accounting, and working at UA.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
literally err-thang

### What will I do next week
Next week will be a frantic struggle between studying for SWE, studying for Computer Networks, and working on the next Computer Graphics assignment.
