### Past week
This past week both the first OOP project and Algo (Algorithms and Complexity) homework were due. Neither were too difficult, but they forced me to get into the swing of getting work done. I procrastinated both assignments, but am hoping to change that in the weeks to come. In class we discussed the differences between references, pointers, and copies. Even though I have learned about these in the past, this further clarified and solidified my knowledge of them. To prep for the career fair, I began updating my resume and bought new business attire.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
My addiction to gymnastics is somewhat in my way because I will still go to the gym even if I need to do homework on some nights. This leads to very late nights of work and me being tired the next day. I need to better balance my time between working out and homework.

### What will I do next week
Next week we will start talking about the second project in class, and I will also start working on it. I still need to read the readings for next week so I will read those tomorrow morning. Since the career fair is coming up the week after next I am continuing to prepare. 

### Tip-of-the-week
Keep in contact with the recruiters of companies you have a strong desire to work for. Even if they do not take you as an intern the first year, or do not allow someone your age to intern, keeping in contact will boost your chances of working with them in the future.
