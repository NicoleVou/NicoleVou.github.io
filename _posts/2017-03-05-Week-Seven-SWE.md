title: Week Seven SWE
---

### Experience in this class 
We discussed some of the strange properties Python has in regards to subclasses and function arguments.


### Past week
This past week I took two midterms, one in Computer Networks and one in SWE. I worked on my computer graphics project, got some tickets done at Under Armour, and completed my online accouting homework.

This SWE test took me off guard. Since I was in Downing's class last semester and I assumed the tests would be very similar. I was ill-prepared for an all multiple choice test (I expected short answer questions) and did not do as well as I would have liked. Like Big Sean, I will bounce back and ace the final exam. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
Not much is in my way this week, since I had both my midterms last week. I do have a lot of work to put in for my computer graphics project. 

### What will I do next week
Next week I will get started on SWE Project 3 with my 5 partners. I need to finish the 3rd computer graphics assignment, my online accounting homework, and whatever excercises are assisgned in Computer Networks. 

### Pick-of-the-week
<a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/overkill" target="target">OVERKILL</a>;  
Overkill immediately kills iTunes upon its opening, saving you from having to endure closing it out and disrupting your work flow. iTunes always opens, is a nuisance, and overkill is a life-saver. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.
