### Experience in this class 
This past week in clas


### Past week
This test took me off guard. Since I was in Downing's class last semester and I assumed the tests would be very similar. I was ill-prepared for an all multiple choice test (I expected short answer questions) and did not do as well as I would have liked. Like Big Sean, I will bounce back and ace the final exam. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
Not much is in my way this week, since I had both my midterms last week. I do have a lot of work to put in for my computer graphics project. 

### What will I do next week
Next week I will get started on SWE Project 3 with my 5 partners. I need to finish the 3rd computer graphics assignment, my online accounting homework, and whatever excercises are assisgned in Computer Networks.
