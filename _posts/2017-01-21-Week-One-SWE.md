title: Week One SWE
---

Yo yo yo, it's good to be back in the blogging business!

### Past week
This past week was a pretty hectic "syllabus week". My class schedule was different everyday this week, and I missed several of the classes that ended up on the final rendition of my schedule. At my part-time internship with Under Armour Connected Fitness, we had a huge deadline for a new feature to be implemented in the MapMyFitness app, with code needing to be in by Thursday at 3pm. Although I usually work a max of 20 hours a week, I had to work extra in order to get my tasks done on time. This was the first time I have encountered this situation in programming in the 'real world', and its a different pressure than strugglign to finish coding assignments on time. You've got the company and coworkers depending on you, millions of people that will be using the code, and more is at stake than just your grade.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
I have a really busy semester ahead of me, and managing everything will be challenging. I am taking 3 computer science courses, two of which are decently time consuming, working 20 hours a week with my part-time internship at Under Armour, and am competing on the UT Club Gymnastics Competitive team. This doesn't give me much wiggle room or free time through out a week, so I will need to always stay focused.

### What will I do next week
Next week I need to get materials for classes (I'm slacking big time), and write down important dates for each class. I will be getting started on the Collatz project, reviewing my linear algebra skills for Computer Graphics, and completing several homework items for my online accounting class.

### Tip-of-the-week
Take one of Downing's classes during your time in UTCS! I took OOP last semester, and liked Downing so much I had to come back for SWE and round 2. 

2017 Spring Semester LEGGO!
