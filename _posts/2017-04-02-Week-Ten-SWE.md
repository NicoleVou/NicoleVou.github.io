### Experience in this class 


### Past week  
Last week I spent a lot of time working on my Computer Graphics project. I also spent more time than usual studying for Computer Networks since we had an excercise, homework, and a test all in one week. My SWE group started setting up the database for Project 4. I almost forgot to do my online accounting homework, but luckily was able to race through and get it all done before the deadline. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
I am going to Ohio on Wednesday afternoon for a national gymnastics competition with the UT competitive club gymnastics team. This week is a pretty busy with week and I have a bunch of large projects due on Thursday and Friday of this week, and I need to work around my trip to Ohio. I should have some time to work on homework while I am there, but for the most part I will be occupied with gymnastics related items.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be meeting with my SWE group partners on Monday and Tuesday and possibly faceTiming in to work with them on the days I am gone. I have a lot to work on with my Computer Graphics project as well so I will try to divide up my time well. Per usual, I have accounting homework, work at Under Armour, and some Computer Networks homework.
