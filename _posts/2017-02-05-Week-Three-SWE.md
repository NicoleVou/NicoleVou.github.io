### Experience in this class 
This past week we discussed some of python's variable types and their functionalities. I found it interesting that there are different variable types for immutable and mutable objects, for example, the immutable version of a mutable array is a tuple. This is quite different than C++, which uses the key word const to make a variable immutable. Also, immutables are hashable, while mutables are not. 
We turned in Project 1 this week, and Downing had some pretty last minute changes he had added to the project. While the changes were not necessarily too difficult to implement, I had to go through a bit of trouble to make the changes and get the project ready for turn in yet again. Since I work full days on Thursday I was pretty cramped on time, which I would have originally avoided since I planned to finish the project by Wednesday.

### Past week
This past week I finished up the Collatz Project, with all of its surprise changes. In class we had a former Downing student come in and talk about the company he worked at: Bloomberg. I enjoy how Downing holds these little talks about companies to allow us to see the different kinds of companies and give us a better since of programming in the real world. I also did the first part of a Computer Graphics project, accounting homework, and work as always. I got a lot of stuff done earlier in the week since I had to go to New Orleans for a gymnastics meet. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
As always, not having a enough time in the day. Between prepping for my gymnastics competition this weekend, working, and having several projects to be done, I have little time to goof around.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be finding a partner for/ starting the Netflix Project. I have a graphcis project to finish, accounting homework to do, and work like usual.

### Tip-of-the-week
Start getting your resume ready for the career fair!! It'll be here before you know it
