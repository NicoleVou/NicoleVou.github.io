### Whatâ€™s in my way
Finishing my Computer Graphics project is what is really in my way right now. My partner and I still have a lot of work to do to be finished by this weekend. The usual amount of work I have to do in a typical week is definitely an obstacle.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be spending most of my time in the lab yet again working on Computer Graphics. I have my accouting homework, computer networks homework, and work (as usual) to do. I need to start studying this week for Exam 1 in SWE since I have another gymnastics meet this weekend at Baylor and will not be able to study too much over the weekend. Hopefully I will have some time to excercise and work on my gymnastics team but I unfortunately do not think I will be able to.

### Tip-of-the-week
Get a water bottle! It is so much easier to drink more water throughout the day if you have a refillable waterbottle. I recommend a camelback as they have top tier customer service and warrantee policies.
