title: Week Five SWE

### Experience in this class 
This past week in class was exciting as I was called on twice this week! We discussed the reduce method, closures, iterables, iterators, generators, and lambdas. A lambda is an unamed function that can be used for all sorts of neat things in python, and can really enhance the readability and elegance of your code. 

### Past week
This past week my partner and I finished up the Netflix project, which seemed easier this go around than last time in OOP. I worked on my Computer Graphics project during most of my free time, completed my online accouting homework, computer networks homework, and some tickets at work. The career fair occurred last week, and it was the first one in my time at UT that I haven't gone. I had a ton of work to do and since I already have an internship lined up for the summer I saw no need to go. My sister was also in town visiting this weekend and I had a great time hanging out with her.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
Finishing my Computer Graphics project is what is really in my way right now. My partner and I still have a lot of work to do to be finished by this weekend. The usual amount of work I have to do in a typical week is definitely an obstacle.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be spending most of my time in the lab yet again working on Computer Graphics. I have my accouting homework, computer networks homework, and work (as usual) to do. I need to start studying this week for Exam 1 in SWE since I have another gymnastics meet this weekend at Baylor and will not be able to study too much over the weekend. Hopefully I will have some time to excercise and work on my gymnastics team but I unfortunately do not think I will be able to.

### Tip-of-the-week
Get a water bottle! It is so much easier to drink more water throughout the day (which is very important!) if you have a refillable waterbottle. I recommend a camelback as they have top tier customer service and warrantee policies.
