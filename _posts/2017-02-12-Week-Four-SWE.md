title: Week Two SWE
---

### Experience in this class 
This weeked in SWE we discussed python iterables and iterators. An object has no next or get next methods, and one can only iterate over one by using an iterator: this allows many users to iterate over an object at the same time. Iterators in python have the very interesting property that once it reaches the end of an object, instead of returning a null or ending value, it raises an exception. Another strange feature in python is the ability to access elements in an object using positive or negative indexes, where negative indexes subtract from the end of the object.

### Past week
This past week was difficult due to a grpahics project I had due on Friday. I spent most of my past week in the GDC lab with my partner frantically trying to debug the ray tracing assignment. We finally finished with 30 minutes to spare. For SWE, my partner and I touched upon a game plan to complete the project by Thursday and started by setting up our repo.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
I have another graphics project due this week, along with the Project 2: Netflix for SWE. It's gonne be difficult to complete both of those with my other homework assignments for Computer Networks and Accouting, along with work and working out.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will also be in the lab all week working on Graphics and Netflix. I will be physically recovering from 4 gymnastics competitions in a row (four weekends in a row) by taking a bunch of ice and epsom salt baths. Also I need to go to the doctor to get a wrist injury checked out.

### Tip-of-the-week
