### Experience in this class 
So far my experience in this class is very similar to my experience in OOP. This first project is the same (different language though), the quiz questions have been the same, and I've even taken the same exact notes as I did last semester. This past week we talked about some of the optimizations for the Collatz conjecture: a couple algorithmic tricks, and a couple using caches. The different caches to implement are lazy, eager, and meta. Lazy caches load in the values as the values get computed through the program running, eager caches compute everything before the code runs, and meta caches already have all the values stored in them. We also discussed ways that methods can communicate with eachother: 1. return values 2. global variables (which are frowned upon in Python) and 3. by passing objects. 

### Past week
This past week was very busy. Being as it was only the second week of classes and I'm already exhausted, I'm a little nervous for the rest of the semester. I had several homework assignments and readings to do, along with my usual 20 hours at UA, gymnastics practices, and our home gymnastics competition which took all day Saturday. I just got back into competitive gymanstics (with the UT club competitive team) and this was my first meet (gymnastics competition) in several years. Needless to say, my body hurts.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
How little time there is in the week. I've got a lot of stuff to do and having more time would be nice. Especially since I have a 10 hour drive to and from New Orleans.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be physically recovering from last week's gymnastics meet, only to be getting ready for another meet in New Orleans this week. I need to stay extremely focused and studious this week so that I do not need to worry about too much schoolwork during the whole trip. I need to start the graphics assignment, finish Collatz (implement caches), complete the accounting assignemnts and get ready for next weekend's gymnastics meet.

### Tip-of-the-week
Get enough sleep. "Sleep is for the weak" has been pretty popualr lately, but don't listen to that. You need sleep to be strong. Both mentally and physcially. I, personally, function at a much lower level when I do not get enough.
