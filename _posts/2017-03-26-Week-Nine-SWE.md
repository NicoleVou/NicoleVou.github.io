title: Week Nine SWE
---

### Experience in this class 
This past week in class we moved onto the topic of relational algebra, which creates new relations from a series of one or more relations using a predicate. This is considered closed since the output is always a relation. As a class we worked on writing several different relational functions, starting with a simple select method, which returned a relation of all the rows within a relation that returned true from a unary predicate. We also wrote project, crossjoin, thetajoin, and natural join methods.

### Past week  
This past week I got pretty sick on Monday, was completely out of commission on Tuesday, and struggling to recover on Wednesday and Thursday. This set me behind for the week in my studies, work, and with gymnastics. Despite being sick, I still worked on the SWE project, got started on my Computer Graphics project, did accounting homework, and went in to work one day.
 
### Whatâ€™s in my way
Catching up from falling behind last week is in my way this week, especially with regards to Computer Graphics. I wasn't able to work on it as much I had wanted last week and will definitely be making up for it this week. I also need to convince my group start working on this next project for SWE early since I am leaving for my national gymnastics competition next Wednesday. 

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be spending alot of time in the lab working on Computer Graphics, working on the next project for SWE, completing my accounting homework, working at UA, and doing the Computer Networks excercise and homework. I also have to study for the Computer Networks test which is on Friday.

### Pick-of-the-week
I am just starting this, but I think it might be helpful when implementing React into our web app. I have never used (or even heard of) React before, and I always learn best using tutorials.
