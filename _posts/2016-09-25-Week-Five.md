### Past week
Here is an actual picture of me the past week:

The week of the career fair is always pretty hectic. It and the events that follow are all pretty time consuming. With the OOP project also due on Thursday I had very little time for things other than computer science (I wasn't able to workout for 4 days!). But I was able to finish everything on time, and killed it at the career fair. :) 

We had an old student of Downing's come in and talk to us about where he worked, JPL. He talked about their agile development process and some really cool projects he worked on. His agile experience was extremely similar to the one we followed at Under Armour. Their way of exploring different ideas for a new project was neat: people take 20 minutes to write down their ideas on sticky notes and then present their ideas to the group. He showed us the HoloLens which JPL had worked on in secret with Microsoft. The Hololens allows scientists to virtually explore Mars in order to better control the Rover.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
I have another busy week coming up. I have two tests this week and several career fair follow-ups. I would say the tests are most in my way at the moment. Also ACL and OU weekend are coming up which take up a lot of time that I really do not have to spare.

### What will I do next week 
Next week I will be doing a lot of studying for the practical liniear algebra and the algo exams. I need to find a partner for the next OOP project so I am able to get the 5 bonus points that I missed out on in this project.
