title: Week Eight SWE
---

### Experience in this class 
We further explored how closures work and many of their uses. We mostly discussed them in the context of being a decorator for another class or method. Decorators, which we also learned about this week, can be used to modify an instance of a class or method. Decorators can be placed before or after said method or class and can contain things like asserts, that you might not want to directly put in the methods or classes. 

Downing cancelled class on Friday, which is the first I've ever seen him do this during my time as his student. He sounded sick on Wednesday so I hope he was OK.

### Past week
This past week was a pretty lax pre-spring-break-week. All of my midterms were the week before this one so there was very little between me and spring break this entire time. My partners and I met up for the SWE project to get some frontend and backend stuff set up.  

### Whatâ€™s in my way
Nothing is in my way next week due to Spring Break, but as soon as I get back I hit the ground running with full force. On top of the SWE project, accounting homework, the next Computer Graphics project, Computer Networks homework, and work (at UA) our state gymnastics competition is this weekend. The week coming back form Spring Break I need to extremely focused and always working.

### What will I do next week
Next week I will be driving up to Taos, New Mexico to ski/snowboard with some friends. I haven't been in a long while and could not be more excited to shred some slopes. 

I will also be getting started on making the splash page and navigation bar for Project 3.

### Pick-of-the-week
Keep up to date with the newest happening is Swift and iPhone development!

This is expecially helpful for migrating to newer Swift versions.
