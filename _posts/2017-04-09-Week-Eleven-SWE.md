title: Week Eleven SWE

### Experience in this class 
This week most of my experience in this class came from the project since I missed two class days (see below for more details! This was also my first time missing a Downing class). On Monday the TA’s discussed the ways they went about creating their interactive web page. I haven’t checked out Downing’s notes yet to see what I missed, but I plan on doing that before the next class period.

### Past week  
I spent most of this past week in Ohio due to a national gymnastics competition, and missed class on both Wednesday and Friday. The UT club gymnastics team placed 2nd in the nation behind Belgium (not sure how they were invited to this NATIONAL competition…), and I placed in several events including 6th place All-Around. The week was hectic since I was trying to get all of my work done either before or during this trip. I worked on the SWE project (mostly React stuff), Computer Graphics, and Accounting. I was too busy to go to work this week, so I will resume that next week.

### What’s in my way
As always, Computer Graphics. My partner and I have been stuck on one part of the project for a couple days now, and I don’t think we will be able to finish in time even though the due date already got pushed back.  

### What will I do next week
Many hours from this next week will be allocated to working on Computer Graphics. For SWE, my group will start putting together a game plan for the last project. Also got to do the usual accounting and computer networks assignments. I also need to find some time to get the axel boot on my car fixed.

### Tip-of-the-week
Registration times for the fall semester are out! Make sure to check yours and plan accordingly.
