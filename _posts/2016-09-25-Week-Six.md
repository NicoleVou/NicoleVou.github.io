### Past week
I took my algorithms test and practical linear algebra test and hopefully did well on both. In addition, I began studying for OOP since we have a test next Thursday. Just when I thought I was finally out, they (OOP) pulled me back in! Regardless, it's a good thing that my tests weren't back to back!

### Whatâ€™s in my way###
I have to start studying seriously for OOP and focus on the actual coding questions. I also have 2 tests (OOP and Business Law and Ethics) that will probably destroy me but it's all good. I also plan on working out if I can, since lifting weights can help you study better. After these tests, I will probably feel pretty relaxed.

### What will I do next week###
Finish the OOP project as well as the upcoming algorithms homework. I just have to keep on top of things and make sure my life is balanced! There seems to be a pattern of periods of intense work then relaxation (which sure beats constant grinding!).

There seems to be a lot of emphasis on writing good code that adheres to object-oriented programming principles. After doing quite a bit of iOS at my internship, I finally understood the importance of this! Having a set of coding standards makes development much easier in general, and we have an obligation to hold up this standard as well.

There is much difference between coding and software engineering. Your average joe could write code that works, but the true beauty and science is in making elegant and robust code. For example, the concept of abstraction and splitting concepts into classes and objects isn't taught very often. To design effective systems and large-scale software, one must be able to deconstruct any idea into it's fundamental pieces using all aspects of computer science.

In OOP, the idea of an iterator being as weak as possible allows any iterator to work for most containers. This idea can be used in many other aspects of computer science, such as making all sorts of software appeal to any input or audiences. If I were to design a mobile app for Android, I would have to make sure that my code works on the lowest framework that I am willing to support. You can get better functionality by making code require advanced features, but at the cost of portability.

Lastly, the inherent idea of an iterator is good as it allows for heavy levels of abstraction. Although we learned similar things in 314 (we actually made an iterator for a linkedlist class), I didn't really appreciate all of this until I did real-world development with Under Armour (Steph Curry with shot boiiiii). So, I am very excited for learning much more about how to design well-written programs using object-oriented programming.

### Tip-of-the-week###
Whenever you go to Chipotle, you can ask for a tortilla on the side (for free!) and it's like 300 calories. Also, make sure you steal like 500 napkins as well as cutlery. xoxo gossip girl
