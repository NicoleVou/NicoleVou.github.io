title: Last Week SWE

### Experience in this class 
This past week in class we continued the student presentations. Since we had our final exam on Thursday, we only had class Monday and Wednesday. The final 2! While their was no grade incentive to attend these last classes (no quiz and nothing to be tested on), I still went to all of them. I found it interesting that the way each group went about their project differed a good amount. 

### Past week  
This past week was action packed with tests, homeworks, work, and projects. I had the SWE test on Thursday, and a Computer Networks test on Friday. Sadly enough, Friday was also the last day of my internship with Under Armour. I had a great time working on MapMyFitness and will very much miss the entire team. I also turned 21 (whoop whoop!) Thursday, but had to postpone all the festivities until Friday night. Atleast I got to take a shot (of tequila) with my manager before I left.

### Whatâ€™s in my way
Nothing is in my way anymore this year! Except for the graphics project I have due tomorrow. After that though, I just have 3 entire weeks of nothing before I fly out to California to intern at FaceBook. During this time, I will continue to play around with our final graphics project, try out the arduino, and do alot of Austiny things! (Bouldering, hiking, kayaking, etc...)
 
### What will I do next week
Next week, after I finish my final Graphics project I really have no game plan for what I am going to do. I'm just going to wake up each morning and see what I feel like doing.

### Pick-of-the-week
