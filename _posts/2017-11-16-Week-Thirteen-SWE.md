### Experience in this class 
This week we continued to refactor our movie rental code. We learned about and implemented singletons into the program: if an object is a singleton, only one instance can be made of it. Since we only needed a maximum of 1 instance of a Price class, this modification is efficient. Downing showed us different ways to intsantiate a class without explicitly using "new A()". Like in OOP, we used room and enchanted room to explore some of the children / parent relationship perk and possible bugs.

### Past week  
This past week my SWE group grinded out the rest of Project 5, and we were able to finish (have it turned in and everything) by Wednesday night. My partner and I started working on our final project for Computer Graphics, which is to create a random world generator similar to the one Minecraft uses. We decided to do this project in Unity, which is new for both of us, but we ended up learning how to use it quickly, and were able to get a good chunk of the project done. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
I do not think I have presented anything in years, and in the next week and a half I have two in class presentations for my projects. I'm a little excited to be presenting, but more so nervous since my public speaking skills need improvement. 

### What will I do next week
Next week, my primary focus will be on Computer Graphics. We need to further our progress on the project, and make a presentation explaining some of the algorithms we are using for the project, along with our goals for it. We present for this class on Friday, so we need to allocate an appropriate amount of time to both making the presentation and actually doing the project. My SWE group and I will also get started on our presentation since we present next Monday.

### Pick-of-the-week
If you are a chrome user and hate watching videos at normal speed, use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en ! It allows you to speed up all HTML 5 videos, including videos on canvas! Now you can learn/watch 20 minutes of material in 10!
