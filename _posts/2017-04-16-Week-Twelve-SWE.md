### Experience in this class 
This week in class we continued the step by step refactoring of a program that keeps track of a customer's rentals, money owed, and points earned at a movie rental store (although the realistic refactoring would be to switch to Netflix!). We cleaned up some code by adding abstract classes as parent classes to the different movie types.

### Past week  
This past week was a scramble to get as much of the Computer Graphics assignment before its due date. We finally were able to overcome the bug we had been stuck on for a week and half on Tuesday, which gave us only 2 days to complete the rest of the project, which was supposed to be even harder than the previous part. For the time we had, we got a decent amount done, but were unable to finish. 

### Whatâ€™s in my way
The biggest thing in my way this week is registration. I messed up and am classified as a junior for next registration period because I did not claim some credits, and did not switch my degree plan. My registration time is now later than I would like it to be and it will be a struggle to register for all the courses I want. Other than that, nothing else poses as an obstacle next week.

### What will I do next week
Next week my SWE group and I will work on completing the last project for SWE, which includes adding a search mechanic to our webpage, visualizing another group's data using their API, and creating user stories.I will be starting on my final project for Computer Graphics, which is creating a random world generator similar to the one in Minecraft using Perlin Noise. In both SWE and Graphics I need to prepare presentations for the final projects.

### Pick-of-the-week
Since we started talking about java in class, here's an interesting article on pattern matching in java: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/pattern-match.html
